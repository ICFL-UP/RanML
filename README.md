Ransomware Machine Learning Framework

This framework, makes it easier to generate machine learning models from datasets. It uses hyperparameter tuning, 10-fold cross validation, and covers 12 Machine learning algorithms in order to find the best model for the given data. 
It also allows for multi-core processing to speed up performance.
